Operators and Operands 
Operators are special symbols that represent computations like adition and multiplications;

The acronym PEMDAS is usful way to rember the order of operations 
P: Parenthese have the highest precedence
E: Exponentiation has the next hightest precedence. Example: 2**1+1 is 3 not 4 
MD : Multiplication and Division have the same precedence which is higher than Addition and Subtractions
