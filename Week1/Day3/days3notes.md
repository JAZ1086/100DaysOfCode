#Stess Testing

Stress testing is a technique for generating thousands of tests with the goal of finding a test case for which your soultion fails.

Stress testing consist of four parts:

1: Algorithm implemented
2: An alternative and trivial and slow but correct implememtation of same algorithm
3: A random test generator
4: Am infinite loop to test both case and compare resutls
